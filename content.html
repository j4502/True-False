  <h2>True/False Film Review: The Act of Killing (Director's Cut)</h2>
  <h3>Oppenheimer's Oscar-nominiated documentary returns in its full and intended form</h3>
  <h4>By Christine Jackson</h4>
  <h5>March 8, 2015 5:34 p.m.</h5>

    <p><span class="firstLetter">T</span>hose who saw The Act of Killing at True/False 2013 did not have the opportunity to see the film in its entirety. The director’s cut of the film is not a director’s cut in the traditional sense. It was not made after the release of The Act of Killing–it was the release. Every country but the United States saw this 159-minute version, which was edited down to fit U.S. theatrical release restrictions.

    <p>The full version of the film takes what was already an incredibly strong documentary and only adds to its power. Previously unseen interactions with the film’s main subject, Anwar Congo, dive further into Congo’s struggle with his guilt, even if guilt is a word he would never use.</p>
    <p>As director Joshua Oppenheimer said in a Qamp:A after the film, “Guilt is a remnant of morality.” Perpetrator, victim or somewhere in between, we are all human and our morality, however well-hidden, reminds us of what we share.</p>

    <p>It’s moments where Congo acknowledges the harm he’s caused to his fellow man and addresses it that make this film so successful. When he finally breaks down and speaks directly to Oppenheimer about how he treated his victims, you almost feel sympathy for the man before remembering the atrocities he’s committed.</p>

    <p>Oppenheimer noted that The Act of Killing is a film about “impunity today, not a genocide 50 years ago.” That fact that the consequences of Congo’s (and his fellow perpetrator’s) actions are so internal makes the human rights themes in the film even more apparent. The smiling grandfather that we follow through five years of footage also played a part in a genocide that claimed the lives of a million innocent people.</p>

    <p>The Act of Killing helped start and is a part of a much larger conversation about how lies shape a perceived truth, and the consequences of that truth being allowed. </p> </div><!--this is the end of mainsection-->
