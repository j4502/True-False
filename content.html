<p>Those who saw The Act of Killing at True/False 2013 did not have the opportunity to see the film in its entirety. The director’s cut of the film is not a director’s cut in the traditional sense. It was not made after the release of The Act of Killing–it was the release. Every country but the United States saw this 159-minute version, which was edited down to fit U.S. theatrical release restrictions.

 <br>The full version of the film takes what was already an incredibly strong documentary and only adds to its power. Previously unseen interactions with the film’s main subject, Anwar Congo, dive further into Congo’s struggle with his guilt, even if guilt is a word he would never use.

 <br>As director Joshua Oppenheimer said in a Q&A after the film, “Guilt is a remnant of morality.” Perpetrator, victim or somewhere in between, we are all human and our morality, however well-hidden, reminds us of what we share.
